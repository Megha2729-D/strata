              At Strata.sg, we believe a good renovation isn't just about a nice finish—it's about creating a space that
              feels right and lasts for years. That's why we only use quality materials that look great and hold up
              well, so you don't have to worry about problems later.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white">
              Our team takes care of the little details, from the basics to the final touches, making sure everything is
              done properly. We know renovation can feel stressful, so we keep things simple—clear quotes, no hidden
              surprises, and regular updates so you always know what's happening.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-white">
              For us, it's really about trust. We want you to feel comfortable, supported, and excited through the whole
              process. In the end, you'll have a space that's not just beautiful but also practical and
              long-lasting—something you'll enjoy every day.
            </p>
